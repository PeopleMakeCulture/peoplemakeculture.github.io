Today I'm challenging myself to start a new practice of taking 10 min at the end of the day to reflect on what I learned that day. The hope is that 1) taking time to reflect and synthesize will make me a better software engineer 2) learning in public will allow others to see what my learning process looks like 3) publishing to Github/the web will create a layer of accountability for me 4) 30 days is long enough to create a habit. 

To that end, I want to adapt a workflow shared with me by [Jake](https://jakelazaroff.com/) [Lazaroff](https://github.com/jakelazaroff). The goal is to:

1. Create one new markdown file every day I work, for thirty days 
2. Create a github action that publishes the new TIL when a new file is created

That's pretty much it!
